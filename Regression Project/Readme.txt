This is a project with the only purpose to learn Linear, Multivariate and polynomial Regression algorithm using jupyter notebooks. 
The dataset was obtained from the Scikit-learn, CalifornianHousing. 
- Only for try Data Wrangler extension in Visual Studio Code, I used the dataset in https://www.dcc.fc.up.pt/~ltorgo/Regression/cal_housing.html, but later I use functions from sklearn.
